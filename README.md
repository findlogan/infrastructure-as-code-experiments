# infrastructure-as-code-experiments

I have decided to open-source experimentation with my "IAC" projects. Feel free to adapt them to your needs or contribute.

> Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key practice in the modern development operations landscape that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. This approach enables developers and operations teams to automate the setup, deployment, and management of infrastructure, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and reliability in the environment. By treating infrastructure as code, teams can apply the same version control, collaboration, and testing practices that are used in application development to infrastructure management. This not only dramatically speeds up the deployment process but also reduces the risk of human error, enhances reproducibility, and scales alongside the application with minimal overhead. Leveraging IaC, organizations can achieve more agile, flexible, and manageable IT operations, paving the way for faster innovation and a stronger alignment between IT services and business needs.

## Useful Documentation/Resources 

### Kubernetes (Container Orchestration)

In my case, I am going to use Kubernetes as container orchestration
.
> Kubernetes manages containers through an abstraction layer provided by the Container Runtime Interface (CRI), allowing it to work with various container runtimes.

### Pulumi

> Pulumi is an open-source infrastructure as code tool that lets developers manage cloud infrastructure using programming languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, and C#. It differs from traditional IaC tools by allowing the use of general-purpose languages, offering more flexibility in defining resources for various cloud providers including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes. This approach enables more reusable and scalable infrastructure code through familiar constructs like loops, functions, and classes. Pulumi simplifies cloud infrastructure management by integrating with existing development tools and practices.
